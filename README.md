# My-Top-5-picks-from-NETFLIX

 React application that displays a list of the user's top 5 Netflix series. Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

### Import Statements:

React and ReactDOM are imported from their respective libraries to use React's core functionality and render the application to the DOM.
"./index.css" is imported to style the application.
Sdata is imported from "./Sdata", which likely contains an array of data objects representing different Netflix series.
Card is imported from "./Cards", which is a React component used to display individual Netflix series.
Rendering the Application:

The ReactDOM.render function is used to render the JSX (HTML-like syntax in JavaScript) to the DOM.

### Inside the render function:
An h1 tag is used to display a heading "My picks of top 5 Netflix Series" with a class name heading_style for styling.
Multiple Card components are rendered. Each Card is passed props (imgsrc, title, sname, and link) which are taken from the Sdata array. These props correspond to the image source, title, series name, and a link to the series.
Card Component:

Although the Card component's code is not provided, it's clear from the context that it is a functional component designed to display information about each series (like an image, title, series name, and a link).

### Data Source:

Sdata is expected to be an array of objects, where each object contains details of a Netflix series such as imgsrc, title, sname, and link.
Rendering:

The ReactDOM.render function mounts the entire application to the HTML element with the id "root". This element is typically found in the index.html file of the React project.

## Summary:
This React code is a small web application that dynamically displays a list of the user's top 5 Netflix series using the Card component, which is passed data from the Sdata array. The application is styled using a CSS file, and everything is rendered inside a root DOM element.
